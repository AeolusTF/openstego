# OpenStego

OpenStego is a steganography application that provides two functionalities:

1. Data Hiding: It can hide any data within a cover file (e.g. images).

2. Watermarking: Watermarking files (e.g. images) with an invisible signature. It can be used to detect unauthorized file copying.

## Usage

* For GUI:

> `java -jar <path>\openstego.jar`

OR

> Use the bundled batch file or shell script to launch the GUI.

* For command line interface:

> Refer to [online documentation](https://www.openstego.com/cmdline.html).
