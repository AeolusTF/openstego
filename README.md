# OpenStego

OpenStego is a steganography application that provides two functionalities:

1. Data Hiding: It can hide any data within a cover file (e.g. images).

2. Watermarking: Watermarking files (e.g. images) with an invisible signature. It can be used to detect unauthorized file copying.

## Usage
